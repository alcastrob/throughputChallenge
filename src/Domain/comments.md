# Domain layer #

This is the most internal layer.

In addition to business logic (the Core Domain), we often also find supporting domain logic within 
the Domain Layer, such as Domain Events (events fired at important points in the business logic) and 
use-cases/commands (definitions of what actions an be taken on our applications).
